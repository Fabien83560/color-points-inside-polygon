# TP1 - Points Inside a Polygon

## <u>Compilation Explanation:</u>

To run the program, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file __main.py__ is located using the command __cd <folder_name>__.

Next, make sure __python3__ is installed. If it isn't, install it using the following command:
```bash
sudo apt install python3
```

## <u>Execution:</u>

Once in the directory containing the file __main.py__, run the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

## <u>Output:</u>

<u>After executing the program, several results will be generated:</u>

- An image named __output.svg__ will be created in the __out__ folder with the following properties:
  - Green points represent points inside the polygon.
  - Red points represent points outside the polygon.
  - Yellow points represent points on the edges of the polygon.

- Additional information will be displayed in the terminal, including the number of points processed and the time taken to perform the calculations.
